=head1 NAME

Bio::KBase::fbaModelServices::Client

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 fbaModelServices

=head2 SYNOPSIS

The FBA Model Services include support related to the reconstruction, curation,
reconciliation, and analysis of metabolic models. This includes commands to:

1.) Load genome typed objects into a workspace

2.) Build a model from a genome typed object and curate the model

3.) Analyze a model with flux balance analysis

4.) Simulate and reconcile a model to an imported set of growth phenotype data

=head2 EXAMPLE OF API USE IN PERL

To use the API, first you need to instantiate a fbaModelServices client object:

my $client = Bio::KBase::fbaModelServices::Client->new;
   
Next, you can run API commands on the client object:
   
my $objmeta = $client->genome_to_workspace({
        genome => "kb|g.0",
        workspace => "myWorkspace"
});
my $objmeta = $client->genome_to_fbamodel({
        model => "myModel"
        workspace => "myWorkspace"
});

=head2 AUTHENTICATION

Each and every function in this service takes a hash reference as
its single argument. This hash reference may contain a key
C<auth> whose value is a bearer token for the user making
the request. If this is not provided a default user "public" is assumed.

=head2 WORKSPACE

A workspace is a named collection of objects owned by a specific
user, that may be viewable or editable by other users.Functions that operate
on workspaces take a C<workspace_id>, which is an alphanumeric string that
uniquely identifies a workspace among all workspaces.
