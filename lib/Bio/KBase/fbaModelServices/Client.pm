=head1 NAME

Bio::KBase::fbaModelServices::Client

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 fbaModelServices

=head2 SYNOPSIS

The FBA Model Services include support related to the reconstruction, curation,
reconciliation, and analysis of metabolic models. This includes commands to:

1.) Load genome typed objects into a workspace

2.) Build a model from a genome typed object and curate the model

3.) Analyze a model with flux balance analysis

4.) Simulate and reconcile a model to an imported set of growth phenotype data

=head2 EXAMPLE OF API USE IN PERL

To use the API, first you need to instantiate a fbaModelServices client object:

my $client = Bio::KBase::fbaModelServices::Client->new;
   
Next, you can run API commands on the client object:
   
my $objmeta = $client->genome_to_workspace({
        genome => "kb|g.0",
        workspace => "myWorkspace"
});
my $objmeta = $client->genome_to_fbamodel({
        model => "myModel"
        workspace => "myWorkspace"
});

=head2 AUTHENTICATION

Each and every function in this service takes a hash reference as
its single argument. This hash reference may contain a key
C<auth> whose value is a bearer token for the user making
the request. If this is not provided a default user "public" is assumed.

=head2 WORKSPACE

A workspace is a named collection of objects owned by a specific
user, that may be viewable or editable by other users.Functions that operate
on workspaces take a C<workspace_id>, which is an alphanumeric string that
uniquely identifies a workspace among all workspaces.

This method creates a set of Prom constraints for a given genome annotation based on a regulatory network
and a collection of gene expression data stored on a workspace.  Parameters are specified in the
CreatePromconstraintParameters object.  
The ID of the new Prom constraints object is returned. The Prom constraints can then be used in conjunction
with an FBA model using FBA Model Services.
