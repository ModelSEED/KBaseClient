=head1 NAME

Bio::KBase::workspaceService::Client

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 workspaceService

=head2 SYNOPSIS

Workspaces are used in KBase to provide an online location for all data, models, and
analysis results. Workspaces are a powerful tool for managing private data, tracking 
workflow provenance, storing and sharing large datasets, and tracking work history. They
have a number of useful characteristics which you will learn about over the course of the
workspace tutorials:

1.) Multiple users can read and write from the same workspace at the same time, 
facilitating collaboration

2.) When an object is overwritten in a workspace, the previous version is preserved and
easily accessible at any time, enabling the use of workspaces to track object provenance

3.) Workspaces have default permissions and user-specific permissions, providing total 
control over the sharing and access of workspace contents

=head2 EXAMPLE OF API USE IN PERL

To use the API, first you need to instantiate a workspace client object:

my $client = Bio::KBase::workspaceService::Client->new;
   
Next, you can run API commands on the client object:
   
my $ws = $client->create_workspace({
        workspace => "foo",
        default_permission => "n"
});
my $objs = $client->list_workspace_objects({
        workspace => "foo"
});
print map { $_->[0] } @$objs;

=head2 AUTHENTICATION

Each and every function in this service takes a hash reference as
its single argument. This hash reference may contain a key
C<auth> whose value is a bearer token for the user making
the request. If this is not provided a default user "public" is assumed.

=head2 WORKSPACE

A workspace is a named collection of objects owned by a specific
user, that may be viewable or editable by other users.Functions that operate
on workspaces take a C<workspace_id>, which is an alphanumeric string that
uniquely identifies a workspace among all workspaces.

Reverts a specified object in a specifed workspace to a previous version of the object.
Returns the metadata of the newly reverted object.
This command still makes a new instance of the object, copying data related to the target instance to the new instance.
This ensures that the object instance always increases and no portion of the object history is ever lost.
